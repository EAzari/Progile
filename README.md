# Product Roadmap


## Product Roadmap basics
A roadmap is not a set document of features to be built. Rather it focuses on the following key points:

* What is your team working on?
* Why are they working on those ideas?
* How do those ideas tie back to the set OKRs?

The roadmap is designed to communicate problems to be solved and open up the conversation for the entire team around how to solve them.

## Understanding the Roadmap

With this in mind, let’s analyze the different areas of a roadmap to understand what it is we are looking at.

### 1. Time Horizons

A solid product roadmap will focus instead on time horizons. These are buckets of time, usually made up of three columns:
* Now: Stuff that you are currently working on. This can include work in discovery and prototyping stages, work in development, or even ‘finished’ work that’s being validated.
* Next: Stuff that’s coming up soon.
* Later: Problems that likely need to be tackled in the future, but need to do a bit more research before you move on.

Some roadmaps may include potential upcoming items as well as completed items, so you can understand the work that’s previously been completed.

### 2. Initiatives

These initiatives talk at a very high level about the work to be done, without digging down into specifics of execution or delivery. This is about understanding the strategy behind this decision – what your team is doing and why they are doing it.

In general, initiatives should focus on highlighting the following information:
* Title
* Description (Problem to be solved/benefits of solving these problems)
* Objective
* Idea pipeline (The experiments to be tried, in order to solve the problem)

we can represent these initiatives in what we call roadmap cards. Aside from the information above, we also can display the following information:
* Roadmap card owner
* Tags (showing teams/product areas – easy for filtering)
* Impact/effort
* Team discussion

### 3. Objectives

Before your team starts any work, they need to understand how this work will impact your overall objectives.

Each initiative will be linked to a set of objectives (likely more than one.)

This will give you an idea of what area will be impacted by this work.

### Tying it all Together – How to Read a Roadmap like a Product Manager

Once you put all these items together on a single document, the roadmap might look something like this.

You can easily spot:
* Initiatives being considered
* What product areas are involved
* The scope of each project (what/why)
* What objectives are being met
* Where in the time horizon these items are

### Turning the roadmap into a conversation piece

Now that you have all the information, problems to be solved and the objectives to be met, take this opportunity to use the roadmap as a conversation piece.

With the right information at your fingertips, you can now ask your product team the right questions, allowing them (and yourself) to manage expectations better.

With better conversations happening, they’ll feel more confident about opening up the product process more and more, giving you better insight into the world of product management.

Open communication and transparency can only lead to great conversations.
